AWS CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that allows you to model and provision AWS resources using configuration files.
Instead of manually creating resources in the AWS Management Console, you can define them in a template (YAML or JSON) and deploy them consistently across environments.
